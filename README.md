# SQL Intermediate and Advanced Project
## Summary
This project is designed to enhance intermediate and advanced SQL skills, enabling you to navigate, manipulate, and analyze data effectively. Through this project, you'll work with relational databases like "Northwind" and "Chinook", tackling a series of challenges and lessons that explore subqueries, common table expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, window functions, and stored routines. The goal is to equip you with the tools and knowledge needed to extract meaningful insights from data and solve complex queries confidently.

## Languages and Tools Used
- Languages: SQL
- Databases: Northwind, Chinook
- Tools: MySQL 8.0 or later (to support window functions)

## Key Learnings
- Mastering foundational SQL concepts through a series of challenges, including joins and aggregations.
- Applying SQL maths for data transformation, KPI calculation, and advanced analysis.
- Breaking down complex queries using subqueries, CTEs, and temporary tables for better efficiency and readability.
- Utilizing window functions to perform advanced analytics without collapsing rows, a critical feature introduced in MySQL 8.0.
- Implementing stored routines such as views, procedures, and functions to streamline database operations.

## Challenges Overcame
- Developing a structured approach to problem-solving with SQL, ensuring that queries remain clear and efficient as they scale in complexity.

## Additional Reflections
- This project reinforced the importance of SQL as a universal language for relational databases, which remains the backbone of data-driven decision-making in various fields.
- The exercises encouraged experimentation and iterative learning, highlighting that making mistakes is a valuable part of mastering SQL.
- By the end of the project, youâ€™ll not only have an advanced understanding of SQL but also the confidence to tackle real-world data management and analysis challenges.
